# ProTerGen

PROcedural TERrain GENerator

Code developed for my Master's degree thesis. This code is deeply experimental. Don't expect it to be completely bug free or optimized for production.

## Building and execution

This project only supports Windows builds. It is necessary to have DirectX 12 and CMAKE v3.12 or above installed. Execute the .bat file to make the CMAKE build. Then use your IDE and compiler of your preference (Microsoft Visual Studio recommended). If you encounter any problem feel free to dm me.
